# Project: Clipping

This is the GitHub repository for the project you named "Clipping", generated from the "yaxt-demo" website template at [yax.com](https://yax.com).

From here, deploy your website for free hosting. Just click a button to deploy your website to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), or [Render.com](https://render.com/). During the process, you will create a second repo for deployment. Name it what you like; I suggest "Clipping-deploy".
